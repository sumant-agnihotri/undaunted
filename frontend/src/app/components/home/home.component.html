    <h3>Outfit Contest</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to Undaunted Insomniac's first Class Outfit Contest! With all the
      motifs flying around, we thought now would be a great time for everyone to
      show off their ESO drip. <br />
      The
      <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/undauntedinsomniacs"
        >rules
      </a>
      are simple, and the prizes are BIG! The goal is to submit an outfit that
      you think best represents your characters class (Templar, Dragonknight,
      Necromancer, Warden, Sorceror, or Nightblade). One winner from each class
      will be chosen and EACH winner will receive 1 MILLION gold! To enter,
      simply post screenshot(s) of your character to
